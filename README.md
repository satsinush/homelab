## üìã Prerequisites

This project is meant for Arch Linux systems using the `pacman` package manager.
Services will run on other operating systems with different package managers, but the installation instructions will be different and the Homelab Dashboard Host API will not function properly.
Before you begin, ensure your device is up to date and that the following packages are installed on your Arch Linux host:

```shell
sudo pacman -Syu
sudo pacman -S openssl apache sed grep xargs docker jq lm_sensors arp-scan openssh wireguard-tools ufw
```

  * After installing `lm_sensors`, run `sudo sensors-detect` to initialize sensor data for Netdata to use.
  * The `apache` package is needed for the `htpasswd` utility used by the setup script to create secure password hashes.


## üíª Host Machine Configuration

Follow these steps to prepare the host server.

### 1\. SSH Security Hardening üîí

For a secure setup, we will configure SSH to use **key-based authentication only**. This makes it much more difficult for an attacker to gain access.

**Step 1: Set Up SSH Key Authentication**

First, ensure you can log in using an SSH key instead of a password.

1.  **On your local machine (not the server)**, generate an SSH key if you don't have one:
    ```shell
    ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
    ```
2.  Copy your **public** key to the server (replace `user` and `server_ip`):
    ```shell
    ssh-copy-id user@server_ip
    ```
3.  Log in to your server using the key to confirm it works:
    ```shell
    ssh user@server_ip
    ```

**Step 2: Harden the SSH Server Configuration**

Now, we'll edit the SSH server configuration file on the server.

1.  Open the configuration file `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`

2.  Make the following changes to improve security:
      * **(Optional)** Change the port from `22` to `2222`. This helps avoid automated scans.
        ```ini
        Port 2222
        ```
      * **Disable root login** to prevent direct access to the most privileged account.
        ```ini
        PermitRootLogin no
        ```
      * **Disable password authentication** to force the use of secure SSH keys.
        ```ini
        PasswordAuthentication no
        PubkeyAuthentication yes
        ```

3.  Save the file and restart the SSH service to apply the changes:
    ```shell
    sudo systemctl restart sshd
    ```

> **Important**: Ensure your new port (`2222/tcp`) is opened in your firewall rules before restarting SSH, or you may lock yourself out.

* **Docs:** [OpenSSH Wiki üîó](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/OpenSSH)

### 2\. Firewall (UFW) Setup üõ°Ô∏è

These instructions configure the Uncomplicated Firewall (UFW) to secure the server.

**Prerequisites:**

  * LAN Subnet: `10.10.10.0/24` (on `end0` interface)
  * VPN Subnet: `10.10.20.0/24` (on `wg0` interface)

Adjust these values in the commands below if your network is different.

**Step 1: Set Default Policies**

First, set the firewall's default behavior: block all incoming and forwarded traffic, but allow all outgoing traffic.

```shell
sudo ufw default deny incoming
sudo ufw default allow outgoing
sudo ufw default deny routed
```

**Step 2: Configure NAT for Forwarding**

For traffic to be routed correctly between the LAN and VPN, Network Address Translation (NAT) must be configured. This is primarily to ensure processes work correctly with WireGuard and Docker.

  * Copy the provided `before.rules` file to the UFW directory:
    ```shell
    sudo cp ./ufw/before.rules /etc/ufw/before.rules
    ```

**Step 3: Add Firewall Rules**

Run the following commands to allow access for your specific applications and enable forwarding between the LAN and VPN.

```shell
# --- CORE ACCESS ---
# Allow WireGuard VPN connections from anywhere
sudo ufw allow 51820/udp

# Allow SSH from LAN and VPN
sudo ufw allow from 10.10.10.0/24 to any port 2222 proto tcp
sudo ufw allow from 10.10.20.0/24 to any port 2222 proto tcp


# --- SERVICE ACCESS ---
# Allow Web (HTTP/S) from LAN and VPN
sudo ufw allow from 10.10.10.0/24 to any port 80,443 proto tcp
sudo ufw allow from 10.10.20.0/24 to any port 80,443 proto tcp

# Allow DNS (Pi-hole) from LAN and VPN
sudo ufw allow from 10.10.10.0/24 to any port 53
sudo ufw allow from 10.10.20.0/24 to any port 53

# Allow RustDesk from LAN and VPN
sudo ufw allow from 10.10.10.0/24 to any port 21114:21119 proto tcp
sudo ufw allow from 10.10.10.0/24 to any port 21116 proto udp
sudo ufw allow from 10.10.20.0/24 to any port 21114:21119 proto tcp
sudo ufw allow from 10.10.20.0/24 to any port 21116 proto udp


# --- FORWARDING RULES ---
# Allow traffic from VPN clients to be forwarded to LAN devices
sudo ufw route allow in on wg0 from 10.10.20.0/24 to 10.10.10.0/24 out on end0

# Allow traffic from LAN devices to be forwarded to VPN clients
sudo ufw route allow in on end0 from 10.10.10.0/24 to 10.10.20.0/24 out on wg0

# Allow traffic from VPN devices to be forwarded to other VPN clients
sudo ufw route allow in on wg0 from 10.10.20.0/24 to 10.10.20.0/24 out on wg0
```

> **Note**: For LAN-to-VPN forwarding to work, you must add a **static route** on your main network router. The route should direct traffic for the `10.10.20.0/24` network to this server's LAN IP address. This is only required if you need LAN devices to initiate connections to VPN devices.

**Step 4: Enable Firewall**

Finally, enable UFW and check the status to confirm the rules are active.

```shell
# Enable the firewall (will prompt 'y/n')
sudo ufw enable

# Check the status
sudo ufw status verbose
```

### 3\. WireGuard VPN Setup üîí

This guide will set up a WireGuard VPN, allowing secure remote access to your server and local network.

**Step 1: Generate Keys**

WireGuard uses public-key cryptography for security. We need to generate a private and public key for the server and for each client (peer) that will connect.

1.  Navigate to the WireGuard directory and set secure permissions:
    ```shell
    sudo -i
    cd /etc/wireguard
    umask 077
    ```
2.  Generate the server's key pair:
    ```shell
    wg genkey | tee server.private | wg pubkey > server.public
    ```
3.  Generate a key pair for each client (e.g., for "my-phone"). Repeat this for every device you want to connect:
    ```shell
    wg genkey | tee my-phone.private | wg pubkey > my-phone.public
    ```
4.  View the keys when you need them with `cat <filename>`. Exit the root shell with `exit`.

**Step 2: Configure the Server**

1.  Copy the example config file:

    ```shell
    sudo cp ./wireguard/wg0.conf /etc/wireguard/wg0.conf
    ```

2.  Edit the server configuration file (`sudo nano /etc/wireguard/wg0.conf`). Use the keys you just generated to fill in the placeholders.

    **Example `wg0.conf`:**

    ```ini
    [Interface]
    # Server's private key (from server.private)
    PrivateKey = <PASTE_SERVER_PRIVATE_KEY>
    Address = 10.10.20.1/24
    ListenPort = 51820

    # --- PEER 1: MY-PHONE ---
    [Peer]
    # Client's public key (from my-phone.public)
    PublicKey = <PASTE_MY-PHONE_PUBLIC_KEY>
    # The IP address this client will use on the VPN
    AllowedIPs = 10.10.20.13/32
    ```

    > **Tip**: It's good practice to align the client's VPN IP with its LAN IP. For example, a PC at `10.10.10.13` on the LAN could be assigned `10.10.20.13` on the VPN.

**Step 3: Enable IP Forwarding**

To allow VPN clients to access your LAN, the server must be able to forward network packets.

  * Create a sysctl configuration file to make this setting permanent:
    ```shell
    echo "net.ipv4.ip_forward=1" | sudo tee /etc/sysctl.d/40-ipv4-forward.conf
    ```

**Step 4: Configure Your Router**

1.  **Port Forwarding:** In your internet router's settings, forward **UDP port 51820** to the LAN IP address of your server (e.g., `10.10.10.10`).
2.  **Static IP/DHCP Reservation:** Ensure your server always has the same LAN IP address by setting a DHCP reservation or a static IP in your router's settings. Do this for other devices you want to have a static IP as well.

**Step 5: Start and Enable the Service**

Apply the IP forwarding rule and start the WireGuard service.

```shell
# Reloads all kernel parameters from /etc/sysctl.d/
sudo sysctl --system

# Starts the WireGuard interface and enables it to start on boot
sudo systemctl enable --now wg-quick@wg0
```

* **Docs:** [WireGuard Quickstart üîó](https://www.wireguard.com/quickstart/)

### 4\. DNS Configuration

1.  **`dhcpcd.conf`**: Configure `/etc/dhcpcd.conf` to prevent the DHCP client from overwriting your custom DNS settings. See [`./dns/dhcpcd.conf`](./dns/dhcpcd.conf) as an example.
2.  **`resolv.conf`**: Configure `/etc/resolv.conf` to prioritize the local Pi-hole resolver while providing a backup DNS for when Pi-hole is not running. See [`./dns/resolv.conf`](./dns/resolv.conf) as an example.
3.  **`resolved.conf`**: Configure `/etc/systemd/resolved.conf` to disable the systemd stub listener on port 53. This is necessary to free up port 53 so that Pi-hole can use it to answer DNS queries. See [`./resolved.conf`](./resolved.conf) as an example.

Apply changes with these commands.

```shell
# Restarts the systemd service that handles DNS resolution
sudo systemctl restart systemd-resolved.service

# Restarts the DHCP client daemon to apply its new configuration
sudo systemctl restart dhcpcd.service
```

## üöÄ Project Deployment

Once the host is configured, follow these steps to deploy the services.

### 1\. Clone & Initialize üìÇ

Clone this repository and its submodules.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/satsinush/homelab.git
cd homelab
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

  * [Git Docs üîó](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git)

### 2\. Configure Environment üìù

1.  **Dynamic DNS**
      * If you use a DDNS service, make sure to copy [`./ddclient/example.ddclient.conf`](./ddclient/example.ddclient.conf) to `./ddclient/ddclient.conf` and fill in your provider's details.
      * [ddclient Docs üîó](https://ddclient.net/)
2.  **Environment Variables**
      * The `setup.sh` script will use `./.env.template` as a base to generate your final `.env` file. Carefully change any values you want to customize in the template **before** running the script.
      * Values in `<angle_brackets>` will be replaced automatically by the setup script.

### 3\. Enable Systemd Services ‚öôÔ∏è

To complete the server setup, you'll need to configure and enable a few custom `systemd` services. These manage the host API, automatic package updates, and automated backups.

#### **Step 1: Copy the Files to Systemd**

Copy the systemd service files to the system directory with this command.

```shell
sudo cp -rv ./systemd/system/* /etc/systemd/system/
```

#### **Step 2: Configure the Service Files**

After copying the files, you must edit them to match your user and home directory.

1.  Open `/etc/systemd/system/homelab-host-api.service`.
2.  Open `/etc/systemd/system/homelab-backup.service`.

In both files, find and replace the usernames and file paths with the correct values.

Replace these lines:
```
WorkingDirectory=/home/USERNAME/homelab
ExecStart=/home/USERNAME/homelab/backup.sh backup --auto

User=USERNAME
Group=USERNAME
WorkingDirectory=/home/USERNAME/homelab/homelab-dashboard/host-api
```

#### **Step 3: Reload Daemon and Enable Services**

First, tell `systemd` to re-read its configuration to detect the new files.

```shell
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

Next, enable and start the new services and timers. The `enable --now` command starts them immediately and also ensures they launch automatically on boot.

```shell
# Custom Services
sudo systemctl enable --now homelab-host-api.service
sudo systemctl enable --now pacman-sync.timer
sudo systemctl enable --now homelab-backup.timer

# You can verify the services are running with
sudo systemctl status homelab-host-api.service
sudo systemctl status pacman-sync.timer
sudo systemctl status homelab-backup.timer
```

Finally, ensure the system's time synchronization service is active, as accurate time is crucial for many services.

```shell
# Enable and start the time sync service
sudo systemctl enable --now systemd-timesyncd

# Check the status
timedatectl status
```

> If **`System clock synchronized`** shows **`no`**, you may need to edit `/etc/systemd/timesyncd.conf` to configure a reliable time source. Check [`./systemd/timesyncd.conf`](./systemd/timesyncd.conf) for an example. After editing, restart the service with `sudo systemctl restart systemd-timesyncd`.

  * [Systemd Docs üîó](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Systemd#Basic_systemctl_usage)

### 4\. Run the Setup Script ‚ö°

Execute the main setup script. It will prompt you to create a username and password and automatically configure and initialize all the services.

```shell
./setup.sh
```

> **Note**: The setup script creates a user-specific email address. You **must** use this email for services like Vaultwarden and Authelia to receive notifications via Ntfy. Your notification topic in Ntfy is `YOUR USERNAME`.

> **Tip**: You can run this script again at any time to recreate SSL certificates. The CA certificate will not be affected and all other settings will stay the same.


## ‚úÖ Post-Installation Checklist

Final configuration steps for individual services.

  * **üìú CA Certificate**
    * Install the generated `homelab-ca.crt` (found in [`./volumes/certificates`](./volumes/certificates/)) on all your client devices to avoid browser security warnings.
  * **üîê Vaultwarden**
    * Create your primary account. You **must** use the email provided to you by the set up script, otherwise ntfy will not create notifcations for password reset emails and you may lose access to your account. Afterwards, you can optionally set `VAULTWARDEN_SIGNUPS_ALLOWED=false` in your `.env` and restart the container to disable public registration.
    * [Vaultwarden Docs üîó](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/blob/main/README.md)
  * **üìà Uptime Kuma**
    * Configure notifications to point to your `ntfy` service using the token from `NTFY_ADMIN_TOKENS` in the `.env` file.
    * [Uptime Kuma Docs üîó](https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma/wiki)
  * **üîî Ntfy**
    * Set the URL to your ntfy domain and log into ntfy with your homelab username and password.
    * Subscribe to the following topics:
      * `homelab-dashboard` topic for package updates.
      * `uptime-kuma` topic for service alerts.
      * `YOUR USERNAME` topic for password reset emails.
    * [Ntfy Docs üîó](https://docs.ntfy.sh/)
  * **üñ•Ô∏è RustDesk**
    * Configure your clients by setting the **ID/Relay Server** to your host's IP/domain. The required public key is printed after running [`./setup.sh`](./setup.sh) or can be obtained by running this command: `docker cp rustdesk-id-server:/root/id_ed25519.pub - | tar -xO`
    * [RustDesk Docs üîó](https://rustdesk.com/docs/)
  * **üö´ Pi-hole**
    * For best results, consider replacing the default adlists with a more lest strict list, such as the [Hagezi Pro list](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hagezi/dns-blocklists/main/adblock/pro.txt). Or if you want to block as much as possible use both.
    * You can test if the ad-blocking service is working by going here [AdBlock Tester](https://adblock-tester.com).
    * [Pi-hole Docs üîó](https://docs.pi-hole.net/)
  * **üîë Authelia**
    * If you need to recover an account, you can retrieve email verification codes by running subcribing to your `YOUR USERNAME` topic in ntfy.
      * [Authelia Docs üîó](https://www.authelia.com/integration/prologue/get-started/)
  * **üè† Homelab Dashboard**
    * Sign into the homelab dashboard using SSO. It's possible to sign in initially with a local account and map it to your SSO account, but this is not recommended.
  * **üì¶ Portainer**
    * Sign into Portainer using either SSO or your local homelab username and password.

### Congratulations! üéâ

You've officially set up your homelab system! Check out the information below for more details on backing up your data, working on development, and troubleshooting issues.

## üíæ Backup and Restore

This project includes a powerful script, [`backup.sh`](./backup.sh), for both manual and automated backups. It archives all essential data‚Äîincluding local configurations, bind mounts (`./volumes`), and Docker named volumes‚Äîinto a single, compressed `.tar.gz` file.

### Creating a Backup

The script supports two ways to create backups.

#### **Manual Backups**

To run a one-off manual backup at any time, use the `backup` command. This will temporarily stop your services, create a single timestamped archive in the `./backups` directory, and then restart everything.

```shell
sudo ./backup.sh backup
```

This will create a file like `./backups/homelab-backup-2025-08-20_19-05-00.tar.gz`.

### Automated Backups (Systemd Timer) üóìÔ∏è

This project uses a `systemd` timer for robust, automated backups. The `homelab-backup.timer` unit, which you enabled during setup, handles this process automatically.

By default, the timer is configured to:

  * Run the backup script with the `--auto` flag **daily at 3:00 AM**.
  * Store the archives in the `./backups/auto/` subdirectory.
  * Keep only the **last 7 backups**, deleting older ones automatically.

#### **Checking the Backup Timer Status**

You can check the status of all timers, including when the next backup is scheduled to run, with the following command:

```shell
systemctl list-timers
```

#### **Viewing Backup Logs**

To see the output from the last time the backup service ran, use `journalctl`:

```shell
sudo journalctl -u homelab-backup.service
```

#### **Changing the Schedule**

To change the backup frequency, edit the `OnCalendar=` line in `/etc/systemd/system/homelab-backup.timer` and then reload the systemd daemon with `sudo systemctl daemon-reload`.

-----

### Restoring from a Backup

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** The restore process is destructive and will overwrite your current data.

For a completely clean restore, follow these steps:

1.  **Full Teardown (Optional):** Completely remove the old stack and all its volumes to prevent any conflicts with old data.
    ```shell
    docker compose down -v
    ```
2.  **Run the Restore Script**: Use the `restore` command, providing the path to the `.tar.gz` archive you want to restore from. The script will handle the rest of the process.
    ```shell
    # Replace with the path to your actual backup archive
    sudo ./backup.sh restore ./backups/auto/homelab-backup-2025-08-20_19-05-00.tar.gz
    ```

-----

### Important Notes

  * The `./backups` directory should be added to your `.gitignore` file.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Development

This project supports a development environment with hot-reloading for the dashboard frontend and backend. This is achieved using a `docker-compose.override.yml` file.

### Frontend and API (Dashboard)

1.  **Enable Development Mode**: To start, make a copy of the example override file.
    ```shell
    cp example.docker-compose.override.yml docker-compose.override.yml
    ```
2.  **Start the Stack**: Launch the services. `docker compose` will automatically detect and use both files.
    ```shell
    docker compose up -d --build --force-recreate
    ```

This development setup starts a separate `dashboard-dev` container running the Vite dev server for the frontend. The main `homelab-dashboard` backend container uses `nodemon` to watch for file changes. Any updates to the API or frontend source code will be updated automatically in the running containers.

You should set the DNS server for your development device to 127.0.0.1 in order to test the pages with their actual domain names.

### Host API

To work on the Host API locally with hot-reloading, you can run it directly on your Arch Linux host.

```shell
# Navigate to the host API directory
cd ./homelab-dashboard/host-api/

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the dev server with nodemon
npm run dev
```

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

This section covers common issues you might encounter and how to resolve them.

### A service is unreachable or a domain won't resolve

This usually indicates a problem with DNS or the firewall.

  * **1. Check Client DNS:** Ensure the device you are using has its DNS server set to the IP address of your Pi-hole. You can test if the domain is resolving correctly by running `ping vaultwarden.your.domain`. It should return the IP of your homelab server.
  * **2. Check Firewall Rules:** Verify that your firewall is not blocking the connection. Run `sudo ufw status` on the server and make sure the necessary ports (like `80`, `443`, `53`) are allowed from your IP address or subnet.

### My browser shows a security warning (e.g., "Your connection is not private")

This happens because your browser doesn't trust your self-generated Certificate Authority (CA).

  * **Solution:** You must install the root CA certificate on all devices that will access the homelab services. The certificate is located at `./volumes/certificates/homelab-ca.crt`. Import this file into your browser's or operating system's trust store.

-----

### A webpage is behaving strangely, not updating, or I'm in a login loop

This is almost always caused by your browser's cache or old cookies, especially with an SSO system like Authelia.

  * **1. Force Refresh:** The quickest fix is to bypass the cache with a hard refresh. Press **`Ctrl+F5`** (or **`Cmd+Shift+R`** on Mac).
  * **2. Clear Site Data:** If a hard refresh doesn't work, clear the cookies and site data for the specific domain in your browser's settings and try again.

-----

### A container is failing to start or is in a restart loop

This typically points to a misconfiguration in your `.env` file, a port conflict, or a file permission issue.

  * **Solution:** The definitive way to diagnose this is to check the container's logs. Run the following command, replacing `<container-name>` with the name of the failing service (e.g., `vaultwarden`).
    ```shell
    docker compose logs <container-name>
    ```
    Look for any lines that start with `Error`, `Fatal`, or mention `Permission Denied`.

-----

### I'm seeing an HTTP error like '404 Not Found' or '502 Bad Gateway'

These errors mean the request reached nginx, but it couldn't be completed.

  * **Cause (404 Not Found):** The reverse proxy received the request but has no configuration for that specific domain. Check your NGINX configuration file for typos in the hostname.
  * **Cause (502 Bad Gateway):** The reverse proxy has a rule, but it cannot communicate with the backend service container. This usually means the service container is stopped, unhealthy, or not on the same Docker network.

  * **Solution:** Check the logs of nginx container for specific error messages.

    ```shell
    docker compose logs nginx
    ```

-----

### Ads are not being blocked on a specific device

This happens when a device's DNS requests are bypassing your Pi-hole.

1.  **Verify Client DNS Settings:** Ensure the device is configured to use your Pi-hole's IP as its **only** DNS server. Remove any secondary servers like `8.8.8.8` or `1.1.1.1`.

2.  **Disable "Secure DNS" in Your Browser:** Most modern browsers have a **DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH)** feature that bypasses Pi-hole entirely. You must disable it in your browser's security settings.
